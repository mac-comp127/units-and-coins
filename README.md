Problem 1: Unit Conversions
---

I have created a `UnitConversions` class that converts between Sheppey and miles. A Sheppey is a measure of distance equal to (7/8) of a mile. It is defined as the closest distance at which sheep remain picturesque! More information on the definition can be
  found at Wikipedia's [List of Humorous Units of Measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_humorous_units_of_measurement#Sheppey). Unfortunately, the UnitConversion class is broken: it always returns zero!

1. Implement the conversion methods correctly, so that the tests in `UnitConversionsTest` all pass.
   (**The tests are already correct.** You only need to change the code in `UnitConversions`.)
2. Using the sheppey methods as an example, add your own **pair** of methods to convert back
   and forth between two units of your choice.
3. Add tests for your new methods to `UnitConversionsTest`.


Problem 2: Minimize Coins
-------------------------

Please complete programming problem 2.9 on page 77 in the Java Foundations book (The problem begins with "Write an application that prompts for and reads a double value representing a monetary amount.")

Paul Cantrell developed the unit conversions assignment using Fahrenheit and Celsius. Bret Jackson updated it to use Sheppy. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
